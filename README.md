# 📋 Smart Scheduling System — Capstone Project  
A web-based scheduling system designed for restaurants to manage staff availability, create schedules, and streamline communication between managers and employees.

---

# 📌 Overview  
The Smart Scheduling System helps restaurants automate and simplify the scheduling process.  
Built in **Bubble.io**, the system allows:

- Managers to create and manage schedules  
- Employees to submit availability  
- Auto-scheduling based on availability  
- Shift confirmations and alerts  
- Simple and mobile-friendly UI  

**Note: This repository includes the full conceptual architecture for a future coded implementation. The current MVP is implemented in Bubble.io and focuses on scheduling, availability, shift confirmations, and the core manager/staff workflows.**

This project follows real software-engineering practices:  
📄 Requirements → 🎨 Design → 🏗️ Development → 🧪 Testing → 📚 Documentation

# 📁 Repository Structure

- `/docs` — Contains documentation including test cases and diagrams
- `/screenshots` — Contains all screenshots of the system pages, UI layouts, workflows, and final demo

## 📸 Screenshots
